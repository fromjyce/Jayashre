                Hey there! &#128075; <br /> I'm a Cyber Security student with a
                knack for both coding and cybersecurity &#128640; <br /> Beyond
                the textbooks, I thrive on hands-on experiences, diving into
                real-world challenges. <br /> I'm all about that continuous
                learning vibe â€“ always hungry for more knowledge. My goal? To
                use my skills to come up with cool, innovative solutions. <br />
                I'm totally open to collaborations, especially when it involves
                strengthening security measures and taking on cyber risks.
                <br /> Let's team up to make the digital world a safer place
